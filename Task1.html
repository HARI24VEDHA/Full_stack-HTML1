    <p style="color:honeydew">Hello everyone,

        This is Harini V, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Cyber Security at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham in Chennai. Originally from Kanchipuram, I am presently residing in Hosur and staying in a hostel in Chennai to continue my higher studies. I completed my schooling in Hosur, and my intermediate education was focused on bio-math.
        
        While my primary focus has been on cybersecurity, I am excited to announce that I am about to embark on a new learning journey in full stack development. I am eager to acquire new skills that will complement my cybersecurity background and broaden my technical expertise.
       
        In addition to full stack development, I have a keen interest in learning other skills such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Despite coming from a different background, I am determinedly pushing myself into this technical world and striving to excel. I believe that combining my knowledge in cybersecurity with full stack development and emerging technologies like AI and machine learning will enable me to build secure, efficient, and innovative digital solutions.
        
        Looking ahead, I aspire to leverage my skills in these domains to contribute to the development of secure and user-friendly digital solutions. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities this new path will bring and am committed to continuous learning and growth.</p>
